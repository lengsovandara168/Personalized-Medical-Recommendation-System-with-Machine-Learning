# Personalized-Medical-Recommendation-System-with-Machine-Learning
 The Personalized Medical Recommendation System is a Python-based application that aims to assist users in diagnosing potential diseases based on their symptoms. By leveraging machine learning, the system analyzes the input symptoms, matches them to a disease, and provides tailored medical advice, including recommended treatments, medications, diets, and lifestyle changes. This system not only serves as a diagnostic tool but also offers personalized health guidance, making it useful for individuals who want to understand their symptoms more clearly or need quick guidance before seeking professional medical help. Its objective is to bridge the gap between basic symptom observation and expert medical advice, making healthcare more accessible, especially in areas with limited medical resources.

# Personalized Medical Recommendation System

## Overview

The **Personalized Medical Recommendation System** is a Python-based application designed to assist users in diagnosing potential diseases based on their symptoms. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes the user's input symptoms, matches them to possible diseases, and provides personalized health recommendations such as treatments, medications, dietary suggestions, and lifestyle changes. The objective of this system is to make healthcare more accessible, especially for individuals in regions with limited medical resources, by bridging the gap between basic symptom observation and expert medical advice.

## Features

- **Symptom Checker**: Allows users to input their symptoms, and the system provides a list of possible diseases associated with those symptoms.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Once a disease is identified, the system generates tailored recommendations, including medications, treatments, diets, and lifestyle modifications.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The system uses a trained machine learning model to predict diseases based on symptom inputs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is designed with ease of use in mind, making it accessible for people with minimal medical knowledge.
- **Privacy**: The system processes user data only during the session and does not store any information after the session ends.

## Installation

Follow these instructions to install and run the **Personalized Medical Recommendation System** locally:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x** (Recommended: Python 3.6 or higher)
- **pip** (Python package installer)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personalized-medical-recommendation-system.git
cd personalized-medical-recommendation-system
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

It is recommended to create a virtual environment for this project. You can do so by following these steps:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should contain the following libraries:

```txt
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
flask  # If you're using Flask for a web interface
matplotlib  # For any visualizations (if applicable)
```

### Step 3: Dataset

Ensure that you have a dataset containing the mapping of diseases to their respective symptoms. You can use a publicly available dataset or create your own. The dataset should be in a format that the system can process (e.g., CSV, JSON).

### Step 4: Run the System

To run the system, execute the Python script:

```bash
python recommendation_system.py
```

If you are using a Flask web interface, run the following command to start the server:

```bash
flask run
```

You can then access the system through your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

1. **Input Symptoms**: The user is prompted to enter a list of symptoms they are experiencing.
2. **Disease Prediction**: Based on the input, the system matches the symptoms to possible diseases using a trained machine learning model.
3. **Personalized Recommendations**: After a disease is identified, the system provides health recommendations including treatments, medications, diet advice, and lifestyle changes.

Example:

```bash
Enter symptoms: fever, cough, body ache
Predicted Disease: Influenza (Flu)
Recommendations:
- Treatment: Antiviral drugs (e.g., Oseltamivir)
- Medications: Antipyretics for fever
- Diet: Rest, hydration, balanced meals
- Lifestyle: Stay home, avoid contact with others, get adequate rest
```

## Limitations

While the system provides helpful recommendations, there are some limitations:
- **Accuracy**: The system's accuracy is based on the dataset and the machine learning model used. It may not always provide the correct diagnosis.
- **Medical Validation**: This system should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice. It is intended as a tool for guiding users in understanding their symptoms and seeking further medical help if necessary.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Model Accuracy**: Integrating larger, more diverse datasets could improve the model's predictions.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Implementing NLP techniques would allow users to describe their symptoms in more natural language (e.g., "I feel nauseous and have a headache").
- **Real-Time Medical Integration**: Future versions could integrate with real-time medical databases or API services to provide up-to-date information on diseases and treatments.

## Contributing
